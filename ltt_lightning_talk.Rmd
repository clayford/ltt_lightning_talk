## Classes at UVA

>- Instructors can get to know students, see them 2-3 times/week for 16 weeks.
>- There is time for repeated assessments.
>- Instructors get second chances to review material, catch up on missed material, redeem themselves after an "off day".
>- There is college credit at stake. The class costs money. Which means...
>- The instructor has authority and students are invested.
>- Hard to drop out after a couple of weeks.

## One-off Library Workshop at UVA

>- See students once for 60 - 90 minutes; don’t get to know them.
>- There are no repeated assessments.
>- There is no second chance to catch up on missed materials or make adjustments.
>- There is no college credit at stake. The class is free. Which means...
>- The teacher-student dynamic isn’t there. The “students” are sometimes faculty, staff, colleagues or community members.
>- People can just leave, drop off Zoom, or not show at all.

## Tips for Teaching a One-off Workshop

>- Prepare and rehearse your introduction. Keep it short and get to the subject matter.
>- Don’t have everyone introduce themselves. 
>- Send a pre-workshop email to help students prepare for the workshop (eg, install software, download data, create account) 
>- Check for late registrations the day of workshop. Send them your pre-workshop email. 
>- Create self-contained workshop materials suitable for self-study and make them publicly available.

## More tips

>- Don't wing it. Have a script or good notes. Be ready. Rehearse. 
>- If teaching something centered around software, make sure you're using the same version as your students. 
>- Avoid using Zoom breakout rooms or enforcing group work.
>- Consider doing exercises together as a class instead of pausing for independent exercises. 
>- Create a pre-workshop checklist and use it. [Here's my checklist](URL)
>- Pause and breathe. Sprinkle in some silence. 
>- Start a little late if you want, but end on time.

## Done!
